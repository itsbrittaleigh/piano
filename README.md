# 2022 Advent CSS / JS Day 3 - Piano
Users should be able to:
- See the keyboard centered on the page
- Whenever a user hovers over a specific key it will change colors:
  - White keys will change to yellow #ffd200
  - Black keys will change to pink #f40082
- When a user clicks on a specific key, it will play an audio clip.
- If a user clicks on one key, then immediately clicks on a second key. The 2 files should both play. Meaning, clicking on one key will not stop an existing audio file from playing.
